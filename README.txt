- make sure your version of node that you are running is on 8.12.0, verision pre issue 7 dont support some functionality like buildq:wq
- next.js also uses <style> tags -> remember those from ticketmaster boi
-lifecycle method: getInitialProps()
  - that runs right away from project build so that where we wanna put our API call


- packages:
  -npm install isomorphic-unfetch
    -fetcher for API
